                        Orleans
                        are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex
                        organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies
                        be
                        draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some
                        accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as
                        opposed
                        to any true symbolism

                        <h2><u>History</u></h2>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the
                        mouth of
                        the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699.
                        Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice.
                        The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account
                        by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                        cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of
                        Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi
                        Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such
                        restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville,
                        a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                        celebration.!

                        <h2><u>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</u></h2>
                        The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi Gras Day, in
                        anticipation of the biggest celebration.

                        Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest
                        all-female Krewe. Nyx is famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe
                        status since their founding in 2011. Nyx has plummeted in membership and can no longer hold
                        their
                        self proclaimed status as a super krewe.

                        Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The
                        parade
                        is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its
                        throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at
                        politicians and celebrities.

                        Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades,
                        ending with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several
                        smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

                        Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on
                        Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and Krewe of Mid-City).

                        The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led
                        Bacchus parade on Sunday night.
