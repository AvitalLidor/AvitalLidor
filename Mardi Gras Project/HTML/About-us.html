            I
            invite you to visit our city to experience the excitement of Mardi Gras! Mayor of New Orleans The
            Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth
            Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event. Spectacular
            parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs,
            called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
            quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!" The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins
            early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through
            the city.
            Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all
            ages. New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place
            to be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
            lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we
            say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!" Sincerely, LaToya Cantrell Mayor of New Orleans <br><img

            <h3>Social clubs</h3>ew Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts
            of many of the parades on or around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both
            social club parades. Zulu is a mostly African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host
            Mardi Gras balls, starting in late January. At these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young
            woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not married and in high school or college) and the king (an older male
            member of the club) present themselves and their court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different
            divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood
            Carnival club ball at local bar room.

            <h3>Costumes and masks</h3>In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members
            on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against
            concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and
            other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their
            masks before entering.

            <h3>When does Mardi Gras start and end?</h3>he Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
            (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

            Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is
            always the day before Ash Wednesday.

            Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
            Wednesday.
