        <button class="accordion">When was the first Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began
                the
                tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their
                guests..
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why are masks worn?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and
                the
                elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question
                below) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent
                begins.
                It is also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat
                Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends
                leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Do I need tickets?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The
                Greatest
                Free Show on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How is a king chosen?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while others
                invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design,
                who
                sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How is the City government involved?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue parade
                permits,
                but that is the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and coordinate their own
                parades.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> What is Twelfth Night?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the official
                start
                of Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night does not.
